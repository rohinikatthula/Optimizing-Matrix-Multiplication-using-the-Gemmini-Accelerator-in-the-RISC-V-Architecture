# Optimizing-Matrix-Multiplication-using-the-Gemmini-Accelerator-in-the-RISC-V-Architecture
Overview:
This project focuses on accelerating matrix multiplication—a core operation in many machine learning and signal processing applications—using the Gemmini hardware accelerator integrated within the RISC-V architecture. By leveraging Gemmini, the goal is to achieve significant performance improvements over traditional software-based matrix multiplication executed on a CPU.
